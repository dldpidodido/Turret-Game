RU Controlled


The mages have taken their stand in small town near a bridge.
The skeletons keep on coming, and never.
We've donig this so long that we now are deathly mages, with withered souls.

The better and cooler the controller, and hacks you make on the game extend our existence
just a few more days, and hours against those skeletons.
